# Recipe Search Application built using Vue.js

This responsive web application  fetches data from a remote third-party API using endpoints that help the user to search for recipes by ingredients, alphabetically, and to randomly search meals stored in the remote API. 

By building this application, I solidified my skills on how to interact with an API, defining parent and child routes in Vue.js, defining layouts, and how to create scalable file and folder structures. While building this Vue.js application, I used the Vue composition API and Tailwind CSS to make best use of these technologies that work very well together.
